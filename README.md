# combat-tracker
As a Group Exercise instructor at the gym, it gets confusing tryinbg to remember which tracks have been used week by week. In an attempt to better serve my classes, I'd like to make a way to track the songs I've used from class to class. 

Initial goal is to set up a database using SQL to set up how the songs, dates, classes etc. After setup, use MVC model to give users a way to create, read, update, or delete information.
